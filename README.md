# 42_gamedev

Just some random games I did for the 20 games challenge, for the gamedev club of 42 Lisbon. Not sure I'll do them all, but I'll update here the ones I do.

## Pong
Was the first project I did, tried to do it only with pixels, collision is far from optimal, but kinda works.

## Joyride
A recreation of Jetpack Joyride, was interesting to get into mlx transparency, collision is much better since we're calculating them with images.
